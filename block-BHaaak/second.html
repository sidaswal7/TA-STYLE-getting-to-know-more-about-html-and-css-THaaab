        <h2>Mountains and it's types</h2>
        <img src="./media/mountain1.png" alt="mountain" width="400" height="400">
        <p>Mountains are really very beautiful and refreshing landscape to look at. Speaking in the geographical terms, mountains are highly elevated part of land. They attain greater height as compared to surrounding land. Mountains are one of the most prominent feature of the Earth’s landscape. They symbolize perfection, success, strength and many other positive traits. The highest tip of the mountain is called it’s ‘Peak’. Although there are other elevated land forms also like, Plateau, Cliff, Hills etc. but the height of mountain is greatest of all. The height of the mountain is calculated on the basis of mean sea level on Earth. Although there is no commonly agreed average height, above which an elevation can be considered a mountain. But in general terms, an elevation above 1,000 meters from the mean sea level can be considered as a mountain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When there are several mountain in continuation, they form a ‘Mountain Chain’. And when these Mountain Chains run parallel to each other, they are called a ‘Mountain Range’. Being at the great heights, most of the mountains are covered with the thick layer of snow throughout the year. And this scenic & serene natural beauty provides good opportunity of recreation also, to the tourists. Mountains generally have a broader base, while their top are narrower. At different altitudes of a mountain, different types floral & faunal species are found. Alpine and Coniferous forests are found at the mountains. Mountains add up tremendous beauty to the surrounding landscape, as the great Himalayas does to the north Indian landscape of our country. And the Alps does to the European landscape, etc.</p>

        <h2>Fold Mountains</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This process involves two forces from opposite sides horizontally. They exert pressure on crustal layer, which tend to compress it. This compression from opposite sides creates fold in it. The upward fold is called anticline (having crest or tip) while the downward fold is called syncline (having trough or bottom). Features formed—U-shaped valley, V-shaped valley.In the formation of fold mountains, when the slopes are gentle they form a U-shaped valley. On the other hand, when the slopes are steep they form a V-shaped valley. Examples of Fold Mountain—The great Himalayas of India.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Block Mountains</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Opposite to the above, block mountains are formed when forces beneath the Earth crust tend to pull a crustal region away in opposite directions. This causes the portion of land in between two opposite moving lands to sink downward, called Graben while the other portion. While the other adjacent landmasses are called Horst. Features formed—Rift Valley. When two landmasses move in opposite directions a depression is created in between, this is called Rift Valley. Examples— Satpura Range in central India, Sierra Nevada in North America.</p>
