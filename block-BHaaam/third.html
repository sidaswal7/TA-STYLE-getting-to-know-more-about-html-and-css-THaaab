            <p>Sports is such an activity that it can be taken up by anyone; at any age and any point in life. Adults, children and elders – everyone alike can take part in sports. Many regard sports as a mere co-curricular or extra-curricular activity in schools. However, in reality, sports play an equally important role as does education in a person’s life. To achieve overall and all-round development in life, one should be well-versed in both sports and culture. While training sharpens the mind, sports sharpens the body and fitness. Thus, both are essential. There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in sports. First and foremost, as known by all and very definitively, competitions increase the physical fitness of an individual. Additionally, sports also contribute to building stable mental well-being of a person. Various researchers show that people who are in the daily practice of sports in any form record better mental as well as physical health. Moreover, sports also eliminates the risk of a person catching diseases or facing any bodily interruptions. Competitions increase immunity and increase people’s stamina.</p>

            <p>Sports also influence the life expectancy of people, increasing the potential years to live of an average human individual. All of us are associated with games somehow or the other in our lives. While at schools and as kids, we were exposed to sports in various forms. However, since many institutions do not make it obligatory to pursue sports in higher academics, some of us are dissociated from its practice. However, a lot of people take up games further, on their own accord. Some people even decide on pursuing a career in the field. A lot of people take up a lot of different kinds of sporting activities. There are many outdoor sports; these include cricket, badminton, football, hockey, volleyball etc. Indoor sports such as various board games, table tennis, chess etc. are also popular. One can choose from a large variety. While outdoor sports contribute heavily in building the physical aspect of one’s being, indoor games have a more psychological impact. However, none of the activities can be categorised in a hard and fast way. Every sporting activity contributes to the well- being of a person, both physically and mentally.</p>
